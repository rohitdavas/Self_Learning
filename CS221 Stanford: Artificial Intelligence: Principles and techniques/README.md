## Hi there
I started learning from CS221:  Artificial Intelligence: Principles and techniques, Stanford, offering now in Summer 2019( June 25- Aug 16)

I am not a student of stanford, I am just auditing it remotely.

> If you want to audit it, there are no videos free of this summer. Slides are great, Professor have provided with notes that are within the slides only. They are great. Assignments are really tough, but interesting.
>
>There are some previous year videos, but I have not found them good.
> I have made my own handwritten notes, but they are some as professor's notes in the slides. Mine I made along with some revision content.

## Hi there, 
This repo contains my lecture notes and other things from Stanford class of [CS 230](https://cs230.stanford.edu/syllabus/).

I am not a student of Stanford, just auditing the course remotely, and leveraging the opensource material of stanford. 
Thanks to AI department stanford for making their department material open to world to read.

**NOTE**
- This classroom was flipped classroom . Students follow deeplearning.ai specialisation from home and classroom lectures are devoted to higher discussions and study.

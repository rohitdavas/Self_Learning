# Hi there, 
>this repo contains all the five course of specialisation materials.
>I highly recommend this specialisation for those who know machine learning and are moving to deeplearning.

Link to the [deeplearning.ai specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Also due to large size of single file, I am not able to upload the slides in this repo. So you can download them from [CS230 website](https://cs230.stanford.edu/syllabus/)

> NOTE : This deeplearnig specialisation is followed in flipped classroom version of stanford [CS230 website](https://cs230.stanford.edu/syllabus/) where kian and Andrew teaches this course. There course videos are also available on this website of [CS230 website](https://cs230.stanford.edu/). It is an interesting course, where Kian teaches in a very simple way, and Andrew gives his thoughtful advices. Enjoy!
